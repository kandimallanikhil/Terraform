S3: Simple storage service (s3) - > We can store the files and retrieve objects in S3. 
In s3, what we store in a bucket is an  "Object" not a file or block.
----------------
Create Bucket : 
->  s3 is region-specific, We can view objects across the region but to access objects across regions or edit them we need to enable Cross-Region Replication (CRR).
-> in s3 " Bucket name " should be unique.
< -- > In S3 we will get 2 types of object Ownership 
   -  ACLs disabled (), ACL enabled.
< -- > Then we have the " Block Public access setting for this bucket " -> by default it will block all public access. 
< -- > Bucket Versioning
< -- > Encryption type - Used to encrypt the data stored in s3
< -- > Bucket key 

- > S3 By default will store our data in 3 AZ. So that if one AZ gets down data will be stored there in other regions.

Rules & Policies : 
--- > The S3 bucket name should be unique.
--- > Buckets are regional-specific.
--- > S3 object size, a single object can be uploaded up to 5TB not more than 5TB and we can upload multiple objects.

s3 Storage class : (this will be by default) 
   1. S3 Standard - Use case: Frequently accessed data.
        - High Durability, -low latency
        -  Cost: Higher cost than other classes due to its fast access.
       Example use case: Websites, applications, and big data analytics.
   2. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): Use case: Less frequently accessed data that requires rapid access when needed.
         - Lower cost than Standard, but with retrieval costs. Suitable for backups, disaster recovery, and data that is 
            accessed less often but needs to be retrieved quickly
         - Cost-effective, highly available. 
         - Cost: Lower cost than Standard but higher retrieval costs.
         - Example use case: Backups, disaster recovery data, or long-term storage that is not frequently accessed.
   3. S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Use case: Data with unpredictable access patterns.
      - Automatically moves data between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent access) based on changing access patterns.
      - Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns.
      - Cost: Slightly higher than S3 Standard, but automatically moves data between two access tiers (frequent and    
           infrequent) to optimize costs.
      - Example use case: Data where access patterns are unpredictable, like logs, backups, or datasets for machine learning.
   4.  S3 One Zone-IA
       - infrequently accessed data that doesn't need to be stored across multiple Availability Zones.
       - Lower cost than Standard-IA, but data is stored in a single Availability Zone, so it is less resilient.
       - Suitable for data that can be recreated or is not critical for high availability.
       - Cost: Lower than S3 Standard-IA since it stores data in a single Availability Zone.
        Example use case: Storing secondary backups, or data that is easily recreatable.

  5.   S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval (mainly used for archiving data )
      - Retrieval Time: Instant access to data, meaning you can retrieve objects within milliseconds, similar to S3 Standard.
      - Cost: More affordable than S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) for storing archived data. However, 
         retrieval is not free, and the cost per retrieval might be higher than in other classes like Standard-IA.
   6. S3 Glacier Flexible retrieval 
      - archival data that is rarely accessed and requires retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
      - Cost: Very low storage cost but high retrieval cost.
       Example use case: Long-term backup, archival data, or compliance data retention.
   7. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
      - Use case: Long-term archival storage with rare access.
      - Performance: Retrieval can take up to 12 hours.
      - Cost: Extremely low storage cost, the lowest among S3 classes, but retrieval costs can be high.
      - Example use case: Data that is rarely accessed, such as legal archives or compliance data with retention policies.
  8.  S3 Outposts
      Use case: Data that needs to be stored on-premises, near your on-premises applications.
