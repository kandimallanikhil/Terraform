S3: Simple storage service (s3) - > We can store the files and retrieve objects in S3. 
In s3, what we store in a bucket is an  "Object" not a file or block.
----------------
Create Bucket : 
->  s3 is region-specific, We can view objects across the region but to access objects across regions or edit them we need to enable Cross-Region Replication (CRR).
-> in s3 " Bucket name " should be unique.
< -- > In S3 we will get 2 types of object Ownership 
   -  ACLs disabled (), ACL enabled.
< -- > Then we have the " Block Public access setting for this bucket " -> by default it will block all public access. 
< -- > Bucket Versioning
< -- > Encryption type - Used to encrypt the data stored in s3
< -- > Bucket key 

- > S3 By default will store our data in 3 AZ. So that if one AZ gets down data will be stored there in other regions.

Rules & Policies : 
--- > The S3 bucket name should be unique.
--- > Buckets are regional-specific.
